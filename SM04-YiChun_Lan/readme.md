I did send the mouseclick's X and Y from the sender to the receiver (by the OSC)
and I want to send back the contour back but fail!

And it is interesting to deal with the mouse click! Get the mouseclick X and Y first,
then send the data as the parameters in the mousePressed function!

Lily asked for Elie's help! So we will test draw the counter to the fbo first!
